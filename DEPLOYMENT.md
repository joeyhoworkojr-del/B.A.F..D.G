# Deploying StatEdge

StatEdge ships as **one app**: the FastAPI backend serves the API under
`/api/v1` and the built React site on every other route. One image, one
deploy, one URL, no CORS.

Two supported paths: **Fly.io** (public production deploy, auto-deploys from
GitHub once set up) and **docker compose** (any VPS or local machine).

## Fly.io — one-time setup (~5 minutes)

1. Install the CLI and sign in:

   ```bash
   curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh
   fly auth signup        # or: fly auth login
   ```

2. Create the app (the name must match the `app =` line in the root
   `fly.toml` — if `statedge-api` is taken, pick another and update it):

   ```bash
   fly apps create statedge-api
   ```

3. First deploy, from the repo root:

   ```bash
   make deploy        # = fly deploy
   ```

   The whole site comes up at `https://statedge-api.fly.dev` — pages and API
   from the same host. No secrets required to run: database/Redis are
   optional and weather works keyless via Open-Meteo. Optional extras:

   ```bash
   fly secrets set FOOTBALL_DATA_API_KEY=... --app statedge-api   # live scores
   ```

4. **Auto-deploy on every push to `main`** — create a deploy token and add it
   to GitHub:

   ```bash
   fly tokens create deploy
   ```

   Copy the full output (one line, starts with `FlyV1 `) into the repo:
   Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret, name
   `FLY_API_TOKEN`. From then on, `.github/workflows/fly-deploy.yml` tests
   and ships the app on every push to `main`.

## docker compose — self-hosted

```bash
make dev        # copies .env.example → .env and runs docker compose up --build
```

- Frontend: http://localhost:5173 (nginx, proxies `/api/` to the backend)
- API + docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
- Postgres + Redis + Celery worker/beat included.

## How the single-app image works

- The root `Dockerfile` builds the React app with `VITE_API_BASE=/`
  (same-origin) and copies `dist/` into the backend image at `/app/static`.
- `src/api/main.py` mounts that directory when it exists: `/assets/*` are
  served as files, unknown non-API paths fall back to `index.html` so
  client-side routes (`/nfl`, `/best-bets`) survive refreshes, and unknown
  `/api/*` paths still 404.
- Run locally without Docker: `make dev-backend` serves the API alone, or
  set `STATIC_DIR=frontend/dist` after `npm run build` to serve both.
